🚀 About the Project

Guess The Number – Car Race Edition is a Streamlit-powered web game that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

Players can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty levels. Each level adjusts the number range and allowed attempts. When the player wins, a car race animation is triggered along with a performance-based score.

This project upgrades a classic CLI game into a modern, interactive web application and was built as part of a hackathon learning experience.

✨ Features

✅ Difficulty Levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)
✅ Random number generation
✅ Attempt limit per level
✅ Instant feedback (Higher / Lower hints)
✅ Car race progress animation
✅ Score calculation system
✅ Game restart option
✅ Smooth UI using Streamlit
